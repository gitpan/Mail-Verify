* Better comments maybe?

* Try to use EXPN and/or VRFY

* Check characters in email address for RFC compliance

* Make an object that would be used to verify the email address, and have
  PrintError and other methods

* Fix PREREQ_PM in Makefile.PL to actually point to the version numbers 
  required (I didn't have time to look through the respective ChangeLogs)

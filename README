NAME
    Mail::Verify - Perl extension for validation of email addresses

SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::Verify qw(isfake);

      $reason = isfake('bill@microsoft.com');
      if ($reason) {
        print "Bad email: $reason\n";
      } elsif (defined($reason)) {
        print "Email address perfect\n";
      } else {
        print "Could not verify email address: EXPN is turned off at target computer";
      }

      $reason = isfake('bigboss', 'mail.acme.com');
      ...

DESCRIPTION
    This module checks validity of email addresses. It ensure the
    existence of a username and domain, unless you specified the
    MTA, searches the DNS for the MTA (if not specified), and then
    attempts to use the SMTP keyword EXPN to verify the username.
    Since EXPN is usually turned off, the module will return *undef*
    in such cases, and defined but false if the verification passed.
    If for any reason the check failed, the module will return a
    string describing the reason.

CAVEATS
    Contemporary ISPs never turn EXPN on, to prevent mail abusers
    harass more efficiently by molesting only existing addresses
    with junk mail. Therefore, this is not an excellent solution to
    check the fill-out forms in your site for users supplying false
    email addresses. Most addresses associated with valid MTAs will
    return *undef*.

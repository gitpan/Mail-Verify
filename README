NAME
    Mail::Verify - Utility to verify an email address

SYNOPSIS
        use Mail::Verify;

DESCRIPTION
    `Mail::Verify' provides a function CheckAddress function for verifying
    email addresses. First the syntax of the email address is checked, then
    it verifies that there is at least one valid MX server accepting email
    for the domain. Using the Net::DNS manpage and the IO::Socket manpage a
    list of MX records (or, falling back on a hosts A record) are checked to
    make sure at least one SMTP server is accepting connections.

ERRORS
    Here are a list of return codes and what they mean:

    0
    The email address appears to be valid.

    1
    No email address was supplied.

    2
    There is a syntaxical error in the email address.

    3
    There are no DNS entries for the host in question (no MX records or A
    records).

    4
    There are no live SMTP servers accepting connections for this email
    address.

EXAMPLES
    This example shows obtaining an email address from a form field and
    verifying it.

      use CGI qw/:standard/;
      use Mail::Verify;
      my $q = new CGI;
      [...]
      my $email = $q->param("emailaddr");
      my $email_ck = Mail::Verify::CheckAddress( $email );
      if( $email_ck ) {
          print '<h1>Form input error: Invalid email address.</h1>';
      }
      [...]
